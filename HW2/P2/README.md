# Implementation

For this task, I implemented a modification of GoogleNet, as detailed in (https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43022.pdf),
in order to account for the relatively smaller size of the images trained on in this dataset as opposed to the ones worked with in the above paper. I was able to train successfully with a learning rate of 0.15, 
with appropriate schedulers, and the Adam Optimizer. The model was able to converge within ~15 epochs.
